/*
================== Instagram Page with EJS ====================

Here one unique file in EJS directory that is 'data.json'
which is full of instagram related data, and now we have to 
use that data and sent it on the screen as a response

where we can use any of these links to see their instagram 
profile 

request URL: http://localhost:1010/ig/dogs
request URL: http://localhost:1010/ig/cats

---------------------------------------------------------------- 

1. To access 'data.json' we need to require it in 'index.js':
const instaData = require("/data.json")
