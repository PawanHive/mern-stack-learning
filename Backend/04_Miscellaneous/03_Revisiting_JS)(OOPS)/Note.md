### 1. What is OOP in JavaScript?

OOP in JavaScript is a way of structuring code using objects that share behavior through prototypes.

⚠️ Key truth:
 JavaScript is prototype-based, not class-based.

Classes in JS are just syntax sugar on top of prototypes.

### 2. Factory Analogy

No OOP → build every product manually.
OOP → blueprint + reusable parts

### 3. Analogy:
OOP is like a blueprint. Instead of building everything from scratch, you create a design once and reuse it to build many objects.

### 3. What Problem Does OOP Solve?

OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) solves the problem of managing growing code complexity.

As applications grow bigger, code becomes harder to understand, reuse, and maintain. OOP provides structure to handle this complexity.

### 4. Why we need it:

- Keeps code structured and readable
- Avoids repeating the same logic
- Makes changes safer and easier
- Helps scale large applications

### 5. To Structure our code we use these:

1. prototype
2. `new` Operator
3. constructor
4. `classes`
5. keywords(`extends`, `super`)
