# #What is Mongoose?

Mongoose is an **ODM (Object Data Modeling)** library for MongoDB and Node.js.

### Why do we need Mongoose?

MongoDB is schema-less (you can store anything).
That’s powerful—but dangerous in real apps 😅

Mongoose adds:

 - **Schemas** (structure for data)  
 - **Validation** (required fields, types, limits)  
 - **Models** (JS representation of collections)  
 - **Middleware** (hooks like pre, post)  
 - **Cleaner** queries (no messy raw MongoDB syntax)  

👉 In short: **MongoDB = flexible, Mongoose = disciplined**
