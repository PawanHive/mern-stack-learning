1. port:
==> Ports are the logical endpoints of a network 
connection that is used to exchange information between 
a web server and a web client.

# Real-life analogy of (port):

Imagine:

    - IP address = Building address
    - Port number = Flat / Room number

👉 Same building, many rooms.

So:

Example: http://localhost:3000

    localhost → your computer
    3000 → Express server door

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. app.listen():
-> app.listen() starts the Express server and makes 
it listen for incoming HTTP requests on a specific port.
-> Without listen(), the server will not run or accept any client requests.
