## Promblem in this Project/Code till here:

Suppose we Create a new post... so new post created but when we try to see the detail of that new created post then we can't see any thing because new post has no **id**

and this problem will solve using **UUID Package**

## Sigma Prime Note:
### Implement: `GET/posts`
Show(view) Route

| Method | Route | Operation |
|----------|--------|-------|
| `GET` | `/posts/:id` | to get one post (using id) |
