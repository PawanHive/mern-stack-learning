# Node.js REPL

## What is Node REPL?

REPL stands for:

Read → Evaluate → Print → Loop

This is exactly how Node.js REPL works:

1. `Read` → reads your input  
2. `Evaluate` → executes the JavaScript  
3. `Print` → shows the result  
4. `Loop` → waits for the next input`  

Node REPL is an **interactive Node.js environment** where you can run JavaScript **line by line** without creating a file.
